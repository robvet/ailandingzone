## Terraform AI landing zone creation

This Terraform file contains the configuration for deploying various Azure AI landing zone resources. Use this to integrate with existing landing zone resources. It initializes data sources, local variables, and modules to create storage accounts, key vaults, log analytics workspaces, application insights instances, container registries, search services, ai studio, ai project, private endpoints for all PaaS services, Azure openai service,Applied AI Services, role-based access control, and diagnostic settings.

The documentation corresponding to three very important modules are belwo. Please refer to the other individual module files for more detailed documentation on each resource.
```

# AI Module
Following are the details of what each module does 

This Terraform module creates resources for an AI Studio and AI Project in Azure. It provisions an AI Studio workspace and an AI Project within the workspace. The module also creates private endpoints for the AI Studio and project.

## Requirements

- Terraform version 0.13 or higher
- Azure AI provider version 2.0 or higher

# Private Endpoint Module

This module is used to create private endpoints in Azure. Private endpoints allow you to securely access Azure services over a private network connection.

## Inputs

- `virtual_network_name` (required): The name of the virtual network where the private endpoint will be created.
- `virtual_network_resource_group_name` (required): The resource group name of the virtual network.
- `private_endpoints_subnet_name` (required): The name of the subnet where the private endpoint will be placed.
- `private_dns_zone_resource_group_name` (required): The resource group name of the private DNS zone. Ensure Following DNS Zones are in place
    - privatelink.api.azureml.ms
    - privatelink.azurecr.io
    - privatelink.blob.core.windows.net
    - privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com
    - privatelink.file.core.windows.net
    - privatelink.notebooks.azure.net
    - privatelink.openai.azure.com
    - privatelink.search.windows.net
    - privatelink.servicebus.windows.net
    - privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net
- `private_endpoints` (required): A list of private endpoint configurations. Each configuration should include the following properties:
    - `privateEndpointName`: The name of the private endpoint.
    - `resourceGroupName`: The resource group name of the private endpoint.
    - `privateDnsZoneName`: The name of the private DNS zone.
    - `resourceId`: The resource ID of the service to be connected to the private endpoint.
    - `privateEndpointGroupId`: The ID of the private endpoint group.


    # Module: aiservices

| Storage Table Data Contributor   |  AI Project       | Storage Account   |
 

#### 2. Ensure all the private DNS zones are created and configured

#### 3. Validate chat playgrounds and assistant playgrounds are functional

#### 4. Ensure you create an OpenAI connection to the AI landing zone specific OpenAI service. It comes pre-deployed with inputs provided in tfvars. 

#### 5. Create compute instances as needed using information in following link:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-compute-instance?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=azure-cli

#### 6. Check every AI engineers have Azure AI developer role in AI project 

#### 7. Ensure you have individual permissions based on your role on backend storage, file system, search service contributor and cognitive services contributor on the OpenAI service

#### 8. Test serverless compute
        1.  Create a prompt flow
        2.  Start the serverless compute and ensure the green check mark is being displayed on the portal
        
#### 9. If you are a super user and requires dedicated compute, you can create your own compute and configure VS code container on that compute
